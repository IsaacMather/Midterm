so what is up with my search function? for some reason it's not respongding
that it's finding things, or that counter is not going up



so what is the difference between crawl_and_list and crawl? it seems like
crawl_and_list does 90% of what crawl is supposed to do





point is to look at the different ddata strucuutres and compare their
effectivenmess in this project, timing them and see if you can discren the
difference between them, and thcause the data set is very small, we may want to
 do them many times (that timing code we used before)

 we're going to crawl the site, store the results that we get, and then we're
 goin to do the search

 the data structures should all return the same results, does it take longer
 for one of the data structures to crawl and store, does it take one longer to
 search, and you can time all of them


 how would we find a list of word we find on a website in a binary tree?
 well, in a binary search tree, the BST condition, everything is lst is smaller
  than the root, and everything on the right is larger than the root, so in
  this case we can store everything alphabetically

  #for all
  for all of these we should not have to write any code for the data structure,
   we should re-use all of out code.

   even if you don't get the results that you expect, think about their
   properties and talk about what you

  #hash table
  we're going to take the string and hash it and store it
  we can use the hashqp we wrote, we should just be able to plug it in


  #avl tree
  is a bst that we're going to use

  #splay tree
  same thing as well
